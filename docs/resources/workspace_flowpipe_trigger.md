```hcl
resource "pipes_workspace" "dev_workspace" {
  handle = "dev"
}

resource "pipes_workspace_flowpipe_trigger" "aws_list_buckets_trigger" {
  workspace = pipes_workspace.dev_workspace.handle
  pipeline = "aws.pipeline.list_s3_buckets"
  args = jsonencode({
    region   = "us-east-1"
    conn     = {
        resource_type  = "connection"
        type           = "aws"

  })
  schedule = jsonencode({
    type   = "interval"
    schedule = "daily"
  })
}
```

**Create an organization workspace flowpipe trigger**

```hcl
resource "pipes_workspace" "dev_workspace" {
  organization = "myorg"
  handle = "dev"
}

resource "pipes_workspace_flowpipe_trigger" "aws_list_buckets_trigger" {
  organization = "myorg"
  workspace = pipes_workspace.dev_workspace.handle
  pipeline = "aws.pipeline.list_s3_buckets"
  args = jsonencode({
    region   = "us-east-1"
