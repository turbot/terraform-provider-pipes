# Resource: pipes_workspace_snapshot

Manages a workspace snapshot.

## Example Usage

**Create a user workspace snapshot**

```hcl
resource "pipes_workspace" "dev_workspace" {
  handle = "dev"
}

resource "pipes_workspace_snapshot" "aws_tags_limit_snapshot" {
  workspace_handle = pipes_workspace.dev_workspace.handle
  data = file("/path/to/file")
  tags = jsonencode({
    name: "aws_tags_limit_snapshot"
  })
  visibility = "workspace"
}
```

**Create an organization workspace snapshot**

```hcl
resource "pipes_workspace" "org_dev_workspace" {
  organization = "testorg"
  handle       = "dev"
}

resource "pipes_workspace_snapshot" "aws_tags_limit_snapshot" {
  organization = pipes_workspace.org_dev_workspace.organization
  workspace_handle = pipes_workspace.dev_workspace.handle
  data = file("/path/to/file")
  tags = jsonencode({
    name: "aws_tags_limit_snapshot"
  })
  visibility = "workspace"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `data` - (Required) The data to be stored for the snapshot.
- `workspace_handle` - (Required) The handle of the workspace to create the snapshot in.
- `organization` - (Optional) The optional organization handle to be used when the snapshot is to be captured for a workspace that belongs to an organization.
- `tags` - (Optional) The JSON-encoded string of tags for the snapshot. Use `jsonencode` on a terraform type to ensure correct escaping e.g. `jsonencode({Foo: "Bar"})`
- `visibility` - (Optional) The scope of the snapshot. Can either be `workspace` or `anyone_with_link`.

## Import

### Import User Workspace Snapshot

User workspace snapshots can be imported using an ID made up of `workspace_handle/snapshot_id`, e.g.,

```sh
terraform import pipes_workspace_snapshot.example dev/snap_cbqgah8smpv7n7sg9o0g_2jh0oc9dg1ums4sxb0xksy5cl
```

### Import Organization Workspace Snapshot

Organization workspace snapshots can be imported using an ID made up of `organization_handle/workspace_handle/snapshot_id`, e.g.,

```sh
terraform import pipes_workspace_snapshot.example myorg/dev/snap_cbqgah8smpv7n7sg9o0g_2jh0oc9dg1ums4sxb0xksy5cl
```
