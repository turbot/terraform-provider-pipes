# Resource: pipes_organization_connection_folder

Manages a connection folder, which is defined on an organization.

## Example Usage

**Create a connection folder in the `acme` organization**

```hcl
resource "pipes_organization_connection_folder" "devops_folder" {
  organization = "acme"
  title = "DevOps"
}
```

**Create a connection folder within another connection folder**

```hcl
resource "pipes_organization_connection_folder" "acme_folder" {
  organization = "acme"
  title = "Acme"
}

resource "pipes_organization_connection_folder" "devops_folder" {
  organization = "acme"
  title = "DevOps"
  parent_id = pipes_organization_connection_folder.acme_folder.id
}
```

**Create a connection within a connection folder**

```hcl
resource "pipes_organization_connection_folder" "acme_folder" {
  organization = "acme"
  title = "Acme"
}

resource "pipes_organization_connection_folder" "devops_folder" {
  organization = "acme"
  title = "DevOps"
  parent_id = pipes_organization_connection_folder.acme_folder.id
}

resource "pipes_organization_connection" "aws_aaa" {
  organization = "acme"
  plugin = "aws"
  handle = "aws_aaa"
  parent_id = pipes_organization_connection_folder.devops_folder.id
  # Non-sensitive
  config = jsonencode({
    regions = ["us-east-1"]
  })
  # Sensitive
  config_sensitive = jsonencode({
    access_key = "redacted"
    secret_key = "redacted"
  })
}
```
