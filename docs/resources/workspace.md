  The `Turbot Pipes Workspace` provides a bounded context for managing, operating, and securing Steampipe resources.

  A workspace comprises a single Steampipe database instance as well as a directory of mod resources such as queries, benchmarks, and controls. Workspaces allow you to separate your Steampipe instances for security, operational, or organizational purposes.
