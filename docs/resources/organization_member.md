# Resource: pipes_organization_member

Manages an organization membership.

This resource allows you to add/remove users from your organization. When
applied, an invitation will be sent to the user to become part of the
organization. When destroyed, either the invitation will be cancelled or the
user will be removed.

## Example Usage

**Invite a user using user handle**

```hcl
resource "pipes_organization" "myorg" {
  handle       = "myorg"
  display_name = "Test Org"
}

resource "pipes_organization_member" "example" {
  organization = pipes_organization.myorg.handle
  user_handle  = "someuser"
  role         = "member"
}
```

**Invite a user using an email address**

```hcl
resource "pipes_organization" "myorg" {
  handle       = "myorg"
  display_name = "Test Org"
}

resource "pipes_organization_member" "example" {
  organization = pipes_organization.myorg.handle
  email        = "user@domain.com"
  role         = "member"
}
```
