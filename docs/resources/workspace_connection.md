# Resource: pipes_workspace_connection

Manages a workspace connection association.

## Example Usage

**Create a user workspace connection association**

```hcl
resource "pipes_workspace" "dev_workspace" {
  handle = "dev"
}

resource "pipes_connection" "dev_conn" {
  handle = "devconn"
  plugin = "bitbucket"
}

resource "pipes_workspace_connection" "test" {
  workspace_handle  = pipes_workspace.dev_workspace.handle
  connection_handle = pipes_connection.dev_conn.handle
}
```

**Create an organization workspace connection association**

```hcl
resource "pipes_workspace" "org_dev_workspace" {
  organization = "testorg"
  handle       = "dev"
}

resource "pipes_connection" "org_dev_conn" {
  organization = "testorg"
  handle       = "devconn"
  plugin       = "bitbucket"
}

resource "pipes_workspace_connection" "org_test" {
  organization      = "testorg"
  workspace_handle  = pipes_workspace.org_dev_workspace.handle
  connection_handle = pipes_connection.org_dev_conn.handle
}
```

## Import

### Import User Workspace Connection

User workspace connections can be imported an ID made up of `workspace_handle/connection_handle`, e.g.,

```sh
terraform import pipes_workspace_connection.example myworkspace/myconn
```

### Import Organization Workspace Connection

Organization workspace connections can be imported using an ID made up of `organization_handle/workspace_handle/connection_handle`, e.g.,

```sh
terraform import pipes_workspace_connection.example myorg/myworkspace/myconn
```
