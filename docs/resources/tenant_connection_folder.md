  title = "Acme"
}

resource "pipes_tenant_connection_folder" "devops_folder" {
  title = "DevOps"
  parent_id = pipes_tenant_connection_folder.acme_folder.id
}

resource "pipes_tenant_connection" "aws_aaa" {
  plugin = "aws"
  handle = "aws_aaa"
  parent_id = pipes_tenant_connection_folder.devops_folder.id
  # Non-sensitive
  config = jsonencode({
    regions = ["us-east-1"]
  })
  # Sensitive
  config_sensitive = jsonencode({
    access_key = "redacted"
