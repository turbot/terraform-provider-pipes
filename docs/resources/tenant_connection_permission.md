  Provides a Pipes Connection Permission resource on a tenant. The `Turbot Pipes Permission` allows connections / connection folders to be shared across tenant, identity, or workspace depending on the level at which the connection / connection folder exists.

# Resource: pipes_tenant_connection_permission

Manages permission for a connection, which is defined on a tenant.

## Example Usage

**Create permission for a tenant level connection to the entire tenant**

```hcl
resource "pipes_tenant_connection" "aws_aaa" {
  plugin = "aws"
  handle = "aws_aaa"
  config = jsonencode({
    access_key = "redacted"
    secret_key = "redacted"
    regions    = ["us-east-1"]
  })
}

resource "pipes_tenant_connection_permission" "aws_aaa" {
  connection_handle  = pipes_tenant_connection.aws_aaa.handle
  tenant_handle      = "acme"
}
```

**Create permission for a tenant level connection to a specific organization**

```hcl
resource "pipes_tenant_connection" "aws_aaa" {
  plugin = "aws"
  handle = "aws_aaa"
  config = jsonencode({
    access_key = "redacted"
    secret_key = "redacted"
    regions    = ["us-east-1"]
  })
}

resource "pipes_tenant_connection_permission" "aws_aaa" {
  connection_handle  = pipes_tenant_connection.aws_aaa.handle
  identity_handle    = "my-org"
}
```

**Create permission for a tenant level connection to a specific workspace of an organization**

```hcl
resource "pipes_tenant_connection" "aws_aaa" {
  plugin = "aws"
  handle = "aws_aaa"
  config = jsonencode({
    access_key = "redacted"
    secret_key = "redacted"
    regions    = ["us-east-1"]
  })
}

resource "pipes_tenant_connection_permission" "aws_aaa" {
  connection_handle  = pipes_tenant_connection.aws_aaa.handle
  identity_handle    = "my-org"
  workspace_handle   = "devops"
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `connection_handle` - (Required) Handle of the connection for which permission needs to be maintained.
- `tenant_handle` - (Optional) Handle of the tenant to which permission needs to be granted.
- `identity_handle` - (Optional) Handle of the identity (user / org) to which permission needs to be granted. Required if permission is to be granted to an identity or a workspace.
- `workspace_handle` - (Optional) Handle of the workspace to which permission needs to be granted. `identity_handle` also needs to be provided to identify the exact workspace.

- `version_id` - The connection version.
- `workspace_id` - Unique identifier of the workspace to which the permission is granted if any.

## Import

Tenant connection permissions can be imported using an ID made up of `connection_handle/permission_id`, e.g.,

```sh
terraform import pipes_tenant_connection_permission.example aws_aaa/p_cqlp0647sic7l5q2n5d0
```
