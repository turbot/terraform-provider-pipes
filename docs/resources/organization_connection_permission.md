# Resource: pipes_organization_connection_permission

Manages permission for a connection, which is defined on an organization.

## Example Usage

**Create permission for an organization connection to the whole org**

```hcl
resource "pipes_organization_connection" "aws_aaa" {
  organization = "acme"
  plugin = "aws"
  handle = "aws_aaa"
  config = jsonencode({
    access_key = "redacted"
    secret_key = "redacted"
    regions    = ["us-east-1"]
  })
}

resource "pipes_organization_connection_permission" "aws_aaa" {
  organization       = "acme"
  connection_handle  = pipes_organization_connection.aws_aaa.handle
  identity_handle    = "myorg"
}
```

**Create permission for an organization connection to a specific workspace**

```hcl
resource "pipes_organization_connection" "aws_aaa" {
  organization = "acme"
  plugin = "aws"
  handle = "aws_aaa"
  config = jsonencode({
    access_key = "redacted"
    secret_key = "redacted"
    regions    = ["us-east-1"]
  })
}

resource "pipes_organization_connection_permission" "aws_aaa" {
  organization       = "acme"
  connection_handle  = pipes_organization_connection.aws_aaa.handle
  identity_handle    = "myorg"
  workspace_handle   = "devops"
}
```
