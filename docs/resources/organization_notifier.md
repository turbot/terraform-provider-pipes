# Resource: pipes_organization_notifier

Manages notifiers in an organization.

This resource allows you to define a list of integrations and related settings 
used to send and receive data to one or more integrations. When applied, a notifier is
created with multiple notifiers which point to existing integrations and their related
setup. When destroyed, the notifier is removed.

## Example Usage

**Setup a notifier to the default email integration**

```hcl
data "pipes_tenant_integration" "tenant_email_integration" {
	handle = "email.default"
}

resource "pipes_organization_notifier" "acme_email_notifier" {
    organization = "acme"
	name         = "email-notifier"
	notifies     = jsonencode([{
		type        = "email"
		integration = data.pipes_tenant_integration.tenant_email_integration.integration_id
		to          = ["user@domain.com"]
	}])
	state        = "enabled"
}
```

**Setup a notifier to the slack integration configured on the tenant**

```hcl
data "pipes_tenant_integration" "slack" {
	handle = "cloud-slack"
}

resource "pipes_organization_notifier" "acme_slack_notifier" {
    organization = "acme"
	name         = "slack-notifier"
	notifies     = jsonencode([{
		type          = "slack"
		channel       = "general"
		integration   = data.pipes_tenant_integration.slack.integration_id
	}])
	state        = "enabled"
}
```
