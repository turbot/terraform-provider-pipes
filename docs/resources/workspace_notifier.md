# Resource: pipes_workspace_notifier

Manages notifiers in a workspace.

This resource allows you to define a list of integrations and related settings 
used to send and receive data to one or more integrations. When applied, a notifier is
created with multiple notifiers which point to existing integrations and their related
setup. When destroyed, the notifier is removed.

## Example Usage

**Setup a notifier to the default email integration**

```hcl
data "pipes_organization_integration" "default_email_integration" {
    organization = "acme"
	handle = "email.default"
}

resource "pipes_workspace_notifier" "dev_email_notifier" {
    organization = "acme"
    workspace    = "dev"
	name         = "email-notifier"
	notifies     = jsonencode([{
		type        = "email"
		integration = data.pipes_organization_integration.default_email_integration.integration_id
		to          = ["user@domain.com"]
	}])
	state        = "enabled"
}
```

**Setup a notifier to the slack integration configured in the organization**

```hcl
data "pipes_organization_integration" "slack" {
    organization = "acme"
	handle = "email.default"
}

resource "pipes_workspace_notifier" "dev_slack_notifier" {
    organization = "acme"
    workspace    = "dev"
	name         = "slack-notifier"
	notifies     = jsonencode([{
		type          = "slack"
		channel       = "general"
		integration   = data.pipes_organization_integration.slack.integration_id
	}])
	state        = "enabled"
}
```
