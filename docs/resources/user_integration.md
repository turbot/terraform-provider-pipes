# Resource: pipes_user_integration

Manages an integration defined for the current user.

## Example Usage

**Create an AWS integration using write-only config (recommended for secrets)**

```hcl
resource "pipes_user_integration" "aws" {
  handle = "aws"
  type   = "aws"

  # write-only config, not stored in state
  config_wo = jsonencode({
    discovery_mode        = "access_key"
    discovery_access_key  = "redacted"
    discovery_secret_key  = "redacted"
    role_name             = "pipes_readonly"
    handle_prefix         = "aws_"
    regions               = ["*"]
    permissions           = []
  })
  config_wo_version = 1
}
```

**Create a GCP integration**

```hcl
resource "pipes_user_integration" "gcp" {
  handle = "gcp"
  type = "gcp"
  config = jsonencode(
    {
      quota_project_setting = "credentials_project_id"
      ignore_error_codes = []
      handle_prefix = "gcp_"
      permissions = []
      credentials = "${path_to_credentials_file}"
    } 
  )
}
```

**Create an Azure integration**

```hcl
resource "pipes_user_integration" "azure" {
  handle = "azure"
  type = "azure"
  # write-only config, not stored in state
  config_wo = jsonencode({
      environment = "AZUREPUBLICCLOUD"
      tenant_id = "redacted"
      client_id = "redacted"
      client_secret = "redacted"
      handle_prefix = "azure_"
      permissions = []
  })
  config_wo_version = 1
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `handle` - (Required) A friendly identifier for your integration.
- `type` - (Required) The type of the integration. Possible values are `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`, `github`.
- `config` - (Optional) JSON configuration for the integration. This value is stored in state and cannot be used alongside `config_wo`. Note: As secrets are not returned from the API, this may show perpetual config drift if secrets are included in this argument.
- `config_wo` - (Optional) Write-only JSON configuration for the integration. This value is **NOT** stored in state and cannot be used alongside `config`). Any changes to this argument require a change to `config_wo_version` in order for Terraform to detect drift.
- `config_wo_version` - (Optional) Integer to indicate a new version of the write-only configuration `config_wo`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `created_at` - The time when the integration was created.
- `created_by` - The handle of the user who created the integration.
- `github_installation_id` - The installation id of the GitHub app. Populated only if the type is `github` and the app is installed successfully.
- `identity_id` - Unique identifier of the identity for which the integration is managed.
- `integration_id` - Unique identifier of the integration.
- `pipeline_id` - Unique identifier of the pipeline created to synchronize the integration in regular intervals.
- `state` - The current state of the integration.
- `state_reason` - The reason for the current state of the integration.
- `tenant_id` - Unique identifier of the tenant where the integration exists.
- `updated_at` - The time when the integration was last updated.
- `updated_by` - The handle of the user who last updated the integration.
- `version_id` - The integration version.

## Import

User integrations can be imported using an ID made up of `user_handle/integration_handle`, e.g.,

```sh
terraform import pipes_user_integration.example alice/aws
```
