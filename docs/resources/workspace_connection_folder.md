Manages a connection folder, which is defined on a workspace.

## Example Usage

**Create a connection folder in the `personal` workspace of a user**

```hcl
resource "pipes_workspace_connection_folder" "devops_folder" {
  workspace = "personal"
  title = "DevOps"
}
```

**Create a connection folder in the `devops` workspace of an organization**

```hcl
resource "pipes_workspace_connection_folder" "devops_folder" {
  organization = "acme"
  workspace = "devops"
  title = "DevOps"
}
```

**Create a connection within a connection folder**

```hcl
resource "pipes_workspace_connection_folder" "aws_folder" {
  organization = "acme"
  workspace = "devops"
  title = "AWS"
}

resource "pipes_workspace_connection_folder" "europe_folder" {
  organization = "acme"
  workspace = "devops"
  title = "Europe"
  parent_id = pipes_workspace_connection_folder.aws_folder.id
}

resource "pipes_workspace_connection" "aws_eu1" {
  organization = "acme"
  workspace = "devops"
  plugin = "aws"
  handle = "aws_eu1"
  parent_id = pipes_workspace_connection_folder.europe_folder.id
  config = jsonencode({
    access_key = "redacted"
    secret_key = "redacted"
    regions    = ["us-east-1"]
  })
}
```
