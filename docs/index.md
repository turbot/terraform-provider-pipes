# Turbot Pipes Provider

<!-- Turbot Pipes provides a hosted platform for Steampipe, simplifying setup and operation, accelerating integration, and providing solutions for collaborating and sharing insights. -->

The [Turbot Pipes](https://pipes.turbot.com/) provider is used to interact
with the resources supported by Turbot Pipes.  The provider needs to be
configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pipes = {
      source = "turbot/pipes"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Turbot Pipes provider
provider "pipes" {
  token = "spt_q9boaa6gutha5g3rgexample"
}

# Create a user workspace
resource "pipes_workspace" "my_user_workspace" {
  # ...
}

# Create an organization workspace
resource "pipes_workspace" "my_org_workspace" {
  organization = 'myorg'
  # ...
}
```

## Argument Reference

- **token** (Required) Token used to authenticate to Turbot Pipes API. You can manage your API tokens from the Settings page for your user account in Turbot Pipes. This can also be set via the `STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_TOKEN` or `PIPES_TOKEN` environment variable. Note that the value in `STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_TOKEN` will take preference if both are set.
- **host** (Optional) The Turbot Pipes Host URL. This defaults to `https://pipes.turbot.com/`. You only need to set this if you are connecting to a remote Turbot Pipes database that is NOT hosted in `https://pipes.turbot.com/`. This can also be set via the `STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_HOST` or `PIPES_HOST` environment variable. Note that the value in `STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_HOST` will take preference if both are set.

## Custom Tenant Setup

After a custom tenant has been created as per [here](https://turbot.com/pipes/docs/tenants#creating-tenants), please follow the steps below to setup arguments for your provider as below:
- Login to your custom tenant using the URL provided via [email](https://turbot.com/pipes/docs/tenants#initial-login) after tenant creation is complete.
- Create a new API token by visiting the Settings page for your user account in Turbot Pipes.
- Use the newly created API token as the value for the `token` argument in your provider configuration. You can also alternately, set the value for the `STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_TOKEN` or `PIPES_TOKEN` environment variable. Note that the value in `STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_TOKEN` will take preference if both are set.
- Set Turbot Pipes Host URL as the value for the `host` argument in the provider configuration. The format for the same is `https://<tenant-handle>.pipes.turbot.com/`. For example, if your tenant handle is `mytenant`, then the Turbot Pipes Host URL will be `https://mytenant.pipes.turbot.com/`. This can also be set via the `STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_HOST` or `PIPES_HOST` environment variable. Note that the value in `STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_HOST` will take preference if both are set.
